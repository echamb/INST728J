    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Emily. I am an artist, designer, and educator in Baltimore, MD. I work at the Baltimore Museum of Art in the Education Department running public programs and in-gallery educational experiences. My goal is to create tools that help visitors to better understand artworks, concepts, and histories in informal educational spaces, such as museums.
    </p>
    <p>I grew up in Baltimore, MD in a neighborhood called Bolton Hill. We lived there until I was 15 years old and then my family moved to a neighborhood called Roland Park. After graduating high school, I went to college in Chicago, Illinois, which focused on fine arts. I lived in Chicago for seven years going to school and working at a number of different museums and companies. In 2015, I moved back to Baltimore to be closer to my family. I now live with my boyfriend in a neighborhood in the city called Patterson Park.

    <h3>List of foods I like to cook:</h3>
    <p>My hobbies include spending time with family and friends. One my my greatest passions is cooking, a tradition I learned from my father. My favorite recipes to cook are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggplant Parmesean</li>
            <li>Boeuf Bourguignon</li>
            <li>Chicken Mirabella</li>
            <li>Roasted Salmon</li>
        </ul>
    <p>One of my favorite pastimes is to watch cooking videos, tutorials, documentaries, and food-exploration/travel shows.  These shows inspire me to be creative, experimental, and daring with my cooking and, thankfully, I have a wonderful boyfriend who gets to be my guinea pig when Iâ€™m trying out new recipes! </p>
